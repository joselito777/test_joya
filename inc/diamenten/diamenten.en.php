When cut in the exact proportions, the diamond reflects the light in a particular way. Its unparalleled hardness (it is one hundred and forty times harder than rubies and sapphires) is due to the special conditions under which it was formed: beneath the high pressure and temperatures in the depths of the earth crust.

The price a diamond is due to the high costs involved in its extraction and because it is rare to find high quality diamonds suitable for cutting.

The well-known four “Cs”: <em>Carat, clarity, cut, colour</em> are the properties that should be taken into account when assessing a diamond’s value. But it is important to establish a relation between them. The “ideal” proportions, for instance, assure a white diamond a total reflection due to the speed of light inside the gemstone. Our goal is to offer our customers the best choice according to their taste and investment. The nature of our business makes it necessary for us to act as consultants on the subject.
