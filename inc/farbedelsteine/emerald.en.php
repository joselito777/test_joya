	From the Greek word, “Smaragdo”, the emerald is the most valued gemstone in the Berill group. Amidst the minerals that give it its particular colour are the chromium and the vanadium. The most expensive emeralds come from Colombia, and the mine of Muzo, 100 kilometres away from Bogotá, produces one of the most sought-after emerald in the world. Brazil, Sambia and India are other important producers of this precious gem.
