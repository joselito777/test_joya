	Because of its high melting and linking point at pure state, these metals can be handled only by expert jewellers. Since our very beginnings, the special attributes of these metals have made them crucial for the high standards of our handcraft work. Because of its specific high weight, its hardness and exclusiveness, the platinum is our first choice for diamondsâ€™ mountings..

	It is one of the rarest and most precious metals in our Planet. It belongs to the same group as the platinum and has similar oxidative proprieties. For certain kind of jewellery such as pendants -which for comfort reason should not be heavy- it is more suitable than platinum. <br>
	Although there are two different concentrations, in our atelier we prefer the most pure one (950-000 or 95%). The same as with platinum, palladium is difficult to work with. However, it is not considered an imitation of platinum as the white gold. <br>
	Not all that glitters is gold. Regardless of fashion and matting processes, our collection uses palladium with a 90 to 99% (990/000 and 900/000) purity, full of fire. Combined with precious gems, palladium gives jewellery a touch of modern elegance. Its combination with platinum gives jewellery a lively and notable look. <br>
	Besides, 18 carat palladium (750/000) completes our highly valued collection, designed with exquisite taste for both men and women.
