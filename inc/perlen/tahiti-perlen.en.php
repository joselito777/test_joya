<h3>Pearls cultivated in Tahiti</h3>
<p>
These pearls are cultivated inside atolls. The coral walls of ancient volcanoes -where all life first began- are porous and make the waters inside richer with the flow of minerals, siliceous, nitrates and salts. All of these feed the first link of the food chain, and help sustain the larvae of the oysters that grow and reproduce in optimal conditions, giving the mother-pearl its characteristic dark tones of green and red that, peculiarly, are only found in pearls from the Cort√©s sea, between Baja California and Mexico.

This kind of pearl is cultivated in the Bivalvo, Pteria Sterna, and it is the only spherical pearl in the world that grows in this kind of oysters normally cultivated with pearl implants, that is to say, directly on the inner wall of the shell.
