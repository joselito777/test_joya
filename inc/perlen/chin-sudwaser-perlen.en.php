<h3>Pearls cultured in China</h3>
<p>
Without any doubt, there are no other pearls that could offer such a wide range of natural colours, nor a richer pearl in terms of nacre (mother-pearl) layers than the freshwater pearls of China. They are cultured mostly in the Tai Hu Lake which is the third-largest freshwater lake in China (2.5 times larger than the Konstanza Lake, the largest in Germany). However, it is not much deeper than 1.5m and therefore practically not navigable. This curiosity results in uncontaminated waters which thereby 
protect and make the culture of pearls possible.

<p>
Chinese freshwater pearls are probably the most extended in the world. Both the 
possibilities of cultivating up to 90 pearls in one mussel, as well as the low-cost labour 
force, result in the commercially most exploited pearl in the world.
</p>
<p>
In China, as in most pearl-farming areas, in order to induce the formation of pearls, 
pre-formed round beads and small pieces of tissue are inserted into the mussel. 
</p>
<p>
Experimental techniques have been proved in order to get pearls with different forms: 
lentil, round, oval or “corn flakes” shapes.
</p>
<p>
According to the piece of epithelium tissue inserted, the most capricious figures can be 
obtained. A variety of colours are also the result of different techniques that are used to 
fulfil fashion demands.

<p>
We work in our studio with a high quality cultured pearl which is obtained after years 
of farming and, due to its high standards, it may reach higher prices than Tahitian and 
Australian pearls’.
