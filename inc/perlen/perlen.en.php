Our heart belongs to the south-sea cultured-pearls (especially Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and Tahiti) and to the Chinese freshwater cultured-pearls, to which we especially devote ourselves. In our shop, we offer a varied and wide range of high quality jewellery and prices. Our creative goldsmith-team has manufactured, under an aesthetic perspective, an exclusive and diversified offer of rings, earrings and necklaces provided with creative pearl clasps and fastenings that add value to our demanding metier.

We are always in pursuit of the highest quality. Hence, these are not pearls produced in the short-term or in large quantities. On the contrary, pearls are usually cultured for 18 to 24 month, in the case of Australian and Tahitian pearls; and only one pearl is cultivated in each oyster, during each term. Weather and oceanic conditions are determinant.
